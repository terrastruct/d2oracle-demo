# `d2oracle` demo

Source code for the blog post
[https://terrastruct.com/blog/post/generate-diagrams-programmatically/](https://terrastruct.com/blog/post/generate-diagrams-programmatically/).

This is a runnable example that reads a (very) limited subset of SQL statements from
`plan.sql` and generates SVGs for each step, also outputting the final `.d2` file when
it's done.

## Run

```
go run main.go
```
